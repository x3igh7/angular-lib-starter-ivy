# AngularLibStarter

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.1.

This is a starting point when developing Angular component library.

## Development server

Run `ng serve angular-starter-app` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate library angular-starter-lib --prefix=lib` to generate a new library. This will add the proper configuration for your new component library.

## Build

Run `ng build <library>` to build a specific library module. It should build as --prod by default.
